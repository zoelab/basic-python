#1. Write a function for checking the speed of drivers. This function should have one parameter: speed.
#If speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
#Otherwise, for every 5km above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”.
#If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”

def speed_check(speed):
    if speed in range(1,70):

            print('License suspended')
        else:
            return('Points' +' '+ str(point))
            
 #2.Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called limit. It should print all the numbers between 0 and limit with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. For example, if the limit is 3, it should print:
 #0 EVEN
 #1 ODD
 #2 EVEN
 #3 ODD
 
 def showNumbers(limit):
    for num in range(0,limit):
        if num%2!=0:
            print(str(num)+ ' ' + 'ODD')

            print(str(num)+ ' ' + 'EVEN')

                    return True
        i=i+1
    return False
    
   #4.Write a function that returns the sum of multiples of 3 and 5 between 0 and limit (parameter). For example, if limit is 20, it should return the sum of 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20.
